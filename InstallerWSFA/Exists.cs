//Your pirate ship can eat a bag of dicks
//Your pirate ship can eat a giant bag of dicks
//Your shitty wee boat is a fucking joke
//It's just the unwanted leftovers of a jobby tuggin' barge
//Your pirate ship can eat a bag of dicks
//Your pirate ship can eat a giant bag of dicks
//You better give us all the money in your treasure chest
//Or Kristof's gonna take a shit on your fucking lawn
//Your pirate ship can eat a bag of dicks
//Your pirate ship can eat a giant bag of dicks
//Your poopdeck is a shithole and your rudder is crap
//And your cannons are incapable of firing twenty feet
//Your pirate ship can eat a bag of dicks
//Your pirate ship can eat a giant bag of dicks
//Your stupid navigator is an alcoholic
//And all your crew look like lego bricks
//Your pirate ship can eat a bag of dicks
//Your pirate ship can eat a giant bag of dicks
