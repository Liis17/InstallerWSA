//It 's pirate party time
//Sailing in in my pirate ship around the seven seas
//I get a funny feeling from my head down to my knees
//The feeling goes no further 'cause my legs are made of wood
//I see a giant disco ball, I know this will be good
//Out of the icy mist, an island appears
//It's shaped like a skull but it stinks like a beer
//I drop the anchor down and take a swig of rum
//It's time to have some fun
//To the east (hey!) To the west (hey!)
//It is time for a quest
//Get ready to drink 'til we die
//To the north(hey!) To the south(hey!)
//Pour that rum in your mouth
//Raise a glass to the sky
//Get ready for a P-A - R - T - Y
//Pirate P - A - R - T - Y
//P - A - R - T - Y
//It's pirate party time

//It's pirate party time
//Welcome to the island where your pirate dreams come true
//Over there is captain Yarrface drinking from a shoe
//Everywhere you dig you'll find some treasure in a chest
//The local tavern's full of crew who want to go on quests
//The sun goes down, that's when the party begins
//We've run out of whisky, so let's drink the gin
//Fire the cannons and load up your guns
//It's time to have some fun
//To the east(hey!) To the west(hey!)
//It is time for a quest
//Get ready to drink 'til we die
//To the north(hey!) To the south(hey!)
//Pour that rum in your mouth
//Raise a glass to the sky
